# FDF
All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal.
Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? 
To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution, and as a result, be better prepared.It’s your turn today to modelize some 3D magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not.
